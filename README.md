- 👋 Hi, I’m @justin-vocke
- 👀 I build optimized and efficient applications with the C#/.NET/React/SQL Server stack, or the MERN stack. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working in the C#/.NET stack but still love learning advanced full-stack MERN topics, software architectures, and other frameworks/libraries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on edtech, health, fintech, anything with a goal of helping others.
