- 👋 Hi, I’m @justin-vocke
- 👀 I’m interested in building rich apps with the C#/.NET/React/SQL Server stack, or the MERN stack. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working in the C#/ASP.NEt stack but still love learning advanced full-stack MERN, software architecture, and other frameworks/libraries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... edtech/health apps/sites.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
